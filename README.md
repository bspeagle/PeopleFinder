# PeopleFinder

This is a tiny app I wrote for my wife's company to target an audience by radius of a location. They ran their user address data through Google Maps to get a lat/long and I used that information to return a targeted list of users. The real magic is in the stored procedure used to query the user table. I didn't write it. I got it off Google. Mad props to whomever I got this from!

It's written in PHP, uses Zurb Foundation for styling and the database is MySQL.

Also includes Terraform environment and Docker config.
